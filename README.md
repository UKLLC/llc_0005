Are immune-mediated diseases risk factors for long COVID?

Inflammation is the process of the body fighting against infection and injury. In inflammatory disorders and allergies this reaction is worse and harms the healthy body. In this study we hope to find out whether people with chronic inflammatory disorders and allergies are more likely to have long-lasting symptoms after Covid infection (long COVID). The findings will let us know whether:
- inflammation plays a role in long Covid
- people with inflammatory disorders and allergies should receive a booster vaccine
- existing medications for inflammatory disorders and allergies could be used to treat or prevent long Covid
